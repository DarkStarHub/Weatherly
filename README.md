Project Summary: I leveraged my expertise in React, front-end development, and responsive design to create a data visualization app that pulls data from the Visual Crossings API. My focus was on crafting a seamless user experience by ensuring dynamic updates and responsiveness across various devices.

Technical Skills & Approach:

-React: Utilized React's efficient component rendering and state management capabilities to dynamically update elements based on the incoming and ever-changing data from the API. This ensured a smooth and responsive user experience.
-Responsive Design: Implemented media queries and conditional rendering, enabling the app to adapt seamlessly to diverse screen sizes and devices, delivering an optimal viewing experience across platforms.

Front-End Development:
-Data Handling: Managed data in JSON format, utilizing Javascript libraries for manipulation, including regular expressions and utility functions.
-Local Storage: Employed local storage to store user-specific information, like previously searched locations, enhancing personalization and convenience.
-Animations & Styling: Incorporated CSS and React media queries for animations and style adjustments, creating a visually engaging and interactive interface.

Chart Creation: Utilized the Recharts library with some customization to design and display insightful visualizations of the data, further enriching the user's understanding.

Benefits: The project demonstrates my proficiency in building dynamic and user-friendly applications using React and front-end development techniques, with a focus on creating a responsive and visually appealing experience for users across various devices.









# How I worked on this project

I created this project to build a data visualization app that pulls data from an api - visual crossings. React was a great choice for it's ability to handle rendering/updating components efficiently based on incoming and changing data.
- Data was handled in JSON format.
- Javascript was relatively simple- data manipulation, regular expressions, utility functions, localstorage to handle previous search locations.
- CSS animations and media queries were used.
- React media queries were also used
- Conditional rendering and conditional classnames made updating and displaying React components easy and efficient.
- useState and useEffect were standard workhorse React Hooks used through the project.
- SVGs were used for all icons, for efficiency and fast loading
- I used Recharts with some customization to create the graphs. Great library.
