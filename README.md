# How I worked on this project

I created this project to build a data visualization app that pulls data from an api - visual crossings. React was a great choice for it's ability to handle rendering/updating components efficiently based on incoming and changing data.
- Data was handled in JSON format.
- Javascript was relatively simple- data manipulation, regular expressions, utility functions, localstorage to handle previous search locations.
- CSS animations and media queries were used.
- React media queries were also used
- Conditional rendering and conditional classnames made updating and displaying React components easy and efficient.
- useState and useEffect were standard workhorse React Hooks used through the project.
- SVGs were used for all icons, for efficiency and fast loading
- I used Recharts with some customization to create the graphs. Great library.
