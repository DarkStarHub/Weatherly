# How I worked on this project

I chose to make a weather app as a data visualization project using weather data fetched from an API. I built the app so that if a different API were to be used in the future, only the API component would need to be changed and the rest of the app would function as normal, with no changes neccessary.

Being a data visualization app, I felt React was a natural choice, allowing React to update select components based on incoming data.

- I selected an API that had a good amount of data (global)- visual crossings.
- The component nature of REACT really made organizing and developing easy for this application. Simple components were created, reused and compounded with other elements throughout the app.
- REACT hooks for handling state and updating components (useState, useContext, useRef) were a blessing, not only performance-wise, but development-wise, regarding page functionality. The Shopping bag was a perfect example of that. They made handling that logic very clean, tidy, and reliable.
- REACT ROUTER made switching pages easy and snappy.
- REACT deployment and cross browser compatibility were a cinch. Love working in REACT.
